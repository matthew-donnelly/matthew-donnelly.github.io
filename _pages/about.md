# About

I am an experimental physicist with an interest in nanofabrication and quantum devices. I completed my PhD in the group of Prof. Michelle Simmons at UNSW, where I developed novel 3D semiconductor devices for quantum computing applications. In my current role at Silicon Quantum Computing I am leading the analogue quantum simulation project, which aims to leverage the atomic precision of our nanofabrication process to shed light on a number of important challenges in the physical sciences, with both fundamental and industrial relevance. I am also involved in our quantum machine learning project, primarily in the application of quantum-enhanced machine learning to strongly correlated electronic systems.

# Research Interests

With scanning tunnelling microscropes (STMs) we can observe in real space the atomic level structure of matter in exquisite detail. It is also possible to use an STM to manipulate matter at the atomic level, such as moving carbon monoxide molecules around on a copper surface to create a stop motion animation ("The Boy and his Atom", see below) or creating 'quantum corals'. Two questions can then be posed: (1) how do you make an atomically assembled device stable so that it can be removed from the space-like vacuums in which STMs must operate? and (2) what intersting and useful things can you make taking advantage of this atomically precise technique?

## Silicon Atom Electronics

Taking inspiration from the booming electronics industry, answers to the first question were pursued largely in silicon. Using lithographic techniques based on hydrogen resists, it is possible to incorporate dopant atoms into a silicon lattice with atomic precision. Low-temperature silicon epitaxy is then used to encapsulate the dopant/s in a monolithic crystal that can then be removed from the UHV of an STM.

## Analogue Quantum Simulation

Condensed matter physics is, in part, concerned with microscopic details of matter, and how these details lead to macroscopic phenomena. Think BCS theory and superconductivty, or bandstructure theory and metallic/insulating materials. Experimental methods therefore strive to control microscopic details and observe the effects of changes in them. Many methods control misccopic details through changes that effect relatively large regions of a material or device, such as the twist-angle in twisted bilayer graphene or band engineering in semiconductor heterostructures. Techniques also exist to engineer microscopic details at a more granular level, and it is one of these techniques that first drew me to experimental research: scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).
