# About

I am an experimental physicist with experience in nanofabrication, cryogenic measurement, and quantum devices. I completed my PhD in the group of Prof. Michelle Simmons at UNSW, where I developed novel 3D atomically-precise devices for quantum computing applications. In my current role at Silicon Quantum Computing I am leading the analogue quantum simulation project, which aims to leverage the atomic precision of our nanofabrication process to shed light on a number of important challenges in the physical sciences, with both fundamental and industrial relevance. I am also involved in our quantum machine learning project, primarily in the application of quantum-enhanced machine learning to strongly correlated electronic systems.

## Atomically Precise Fabrication 

Condensed matter physics is, in part, concerned with microscopic details of matter, and how these details lead to macroscopic phenomena. Think BCS theory and superconductivty, or bandstructure theory and metallic/insulating materials. Experimental methods therefore strive to control microscopic details and observe the effects of changes in them. Many methods control misccopic details through changes that effect relatively large regions of a material or device, such as the twist-angle in twisted bilayer graphene or band engineering in semiconductor heterostructures. Techniques also exist to engineer microscopic details at a more granular level, and it is one of these techniques that first drew me to experimental research: scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).
