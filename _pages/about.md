# About

I am an experimental physicist with experience in nanofabrication, cryogenic measurement, and quantum devices. I completed my PhD in the group of Prof. Michelle Simmons at UNSW, where I developed novel 3D atomically-precise devices for quantum computing applications. In my current role at Silicon Quantum Computing I am leading the analogue quantum simulation project, which aims to leverage the atomic precision of our nanofabrication process to shed light on a number of important challenges in the physical sciences, with both fundamental and industrial relevance. I am also involved in our quantum machine learning project, primarily in the application of quantum-enhanced machine learning to strongly correlated electronic systems.
